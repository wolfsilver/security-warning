## Overview

Remove Security Warning is a Visual Studio Code plugin designed to address the security warning popup issue that occurs on the Windows platform when attempting to open VS Code using the vscode:// protocol. Typically, when an external application tries to launch VS Code via the vscode:// protocol, it triggers a system security warning, asking the user whether to allow this operation. The purpose of this plugin is to eliminate this security prompt, ensuring that no warning pops up when launching VS Code via the vscode:// protocol.

## Considerations

Before using the Remove Security Warning plugin, please be aware of the following:

- **Security Considerations**: Disabling security warnings may reduce the overall security of VS Code. Therefore, it is recommended to use this plugin only when you trust the sources of external applications.

- **Assumption of Risk**: Users assume full responsibility for any consequences resulting from the use of this plugin. Ensure that you understand the potential risks and make an informed decision.

- **Windows Platform Only**: This plugin is specifically designed for the Windows platform since other platforms generally do not have similar security warning popups.
